			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I've been doing web development stuff for a good 10/11 years now.</p>
			<p>Professionally, I work a digital publishers called YUDU Media and been there for years. My Technical skills include solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Graphic Design. Or to more specifically break it down... HTML4/5, CSS2/3, Sass, EcmaScript 5 + 6 (Harmony), Angular.js, Typescript, PHP5, MySQL, and mashing up Web APIs like those provided by Google/Twitter etc.</p>
			<p>To date I've built and submitted iOS/Android/Web apps for small names like the Financial Times, KPMG, Mixmag, the FA to name a few.</p>
			<p>Currently, I work as an Account Manager advising on the best strategy and way forward for clients. I currently look after Time Out, Screwfix, and just shy of 100 others. What I reeeeaaaally want to do is more freelance development. So hit me up if you've got something you want to create!</p>
